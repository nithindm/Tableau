   - Add appropriate tooltips everywhere.


   - Add the Year(New Order Date), Region and Category filters on top. All filters must be in multiple values dropdown mode. These filters should be applied to all the worksheets used in dashboard 1 and dashboard 2. Make sure Year filter should not be applied to current year sales, previous year sales and YoY growth % as these values are for current year and previous year. Make sure to apply filters on table in dashboard 2.

   - Initially filters are in hidden state. If you click on show filters icon the filters need to open. When you click on hide filters icon the filters should hide back.

   - Apply filter actions keeping bar chart, donut chart and Top 5 bar chart as source and all the worksheets as target.

   - Make sure to show top 5 products w.r.t. sum of sales every time irrespective of any filter action values you select or any dropdown filter values you select.
